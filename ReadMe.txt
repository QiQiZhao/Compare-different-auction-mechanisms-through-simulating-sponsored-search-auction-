My code is mainly in four files: FinalDataProcess.ipynb, GenerateBid.ipynb, ExecuteAuction.ipynb, and GFP_Auction
In FinaDataProcess.ipynb, it includes the process of processing data
In GenerateBid.ipynb, it includes the process of generating bids for advertisers.
In Execute Auction.ipynb, it includes the process of sponsored search auctions.
In GFP_Auction.ipynb, it includes the process of GFP. In GFP, because the bid strategy I used is DAB, I set it has 20 rounds, while in other auctions I only set 1 round. So, I execute GFP auction in a sole file.


Documents of Keyword1 to 6 includes bidders' information files, such as bidders' quality score and bids.
